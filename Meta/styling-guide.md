# Styling Guidelines
- File may start with metadata in JSON format (to be implemented)
- Article must start with a H1 (# Heading)
    - This will be used as the article's title
- Article may not contain more than one H1
- Use headings in order (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Do not add additional line breaks (\<br>) in front of headings. The markdown renderer will add padding anyways
