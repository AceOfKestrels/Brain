# Forms
Angular can provide a JavaScript object representation of an HTML form. This can be used to easily retrieve data or validate the input.

There are two approaches Angular offers when it comes to forms: *Template-Driven* and *Reactive*

- In a Template-Driven form, Angular infers the object structure directly from the DOM
- Using the Reactive approach, the structure is set up and connected manually. This is more complex, but also allows for greater control
